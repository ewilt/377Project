# Prince George’s County Health Finder 
 
PGHF has been designed to facilitate the user’s ability to locate medical services in Prince George’s County, Maryland. 
 
Created by Information Science students at the University of Maryland, College Park, the design of PGHF took into account the great deal of tourism and visitors that Prince George’s county experiences on a daily basis. With such a great deal of out-of-county individuals spending time in PG County, finding things such a medical services can be difficult.  
 
PGHF allows a user to input an address, which could be their current location, or that of their work or school. The app then returns a map view of their location and the closest hospital, along with the contact information of that hospital.
